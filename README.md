# NNLearningRateRewindingProject

The CornDisease*Detection* file is the file Siddarth wrote to train the base model.

The CornDisease*Pruning*2 file is the file I wrote to apply iterative learning rate rewinding to the model.

The models themselves are mostly too big to upload to github. The original one compressed to 40MB, and by the time we got to the eight iteration of rewinding it compresses down to 11MB.
